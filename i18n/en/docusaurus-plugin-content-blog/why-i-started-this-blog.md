Hello, I'm Walter Gui, a technical writer. Welcome to my blog, **Flowing Docs**.

Actually, I've wanted to write a blog for a long time, but I kept putting it off. This time, I finally made up my mind to write an article first and set a flag, so I won't give up halfway. For me, writing a blog is about finding a place to organize scattered thoughts and share them. If this content is helpful to you, that would be the best encouragement for me.

Many tech people have set up blogs, but stopped after a few posts. I hope I can stick with it.

After several years of working on technical documentation, I've discovered that writing good documentation is not easy. Besides having a technical foundation, what's more important is understanding user needs and having some product and market perspective.

So I plan to record some thoughts and experiences from the process of technical communication, as well as use it as my own reflection and summary. Occasionally, I'll also write about life and technical experiments. Mainly around these directions:

- **Technical Writing & Documentation Engineering**
  
  Docs as Code practices, content architecture design, content reuse, sharing practical experiences and lessons learned.

- **Developer Experience (DX) & Technical Communication**
  
  How to write more user-friendly copy, how to translate technical language into expressions that users can understand.

- **AI & Open Source Tool Practices**
  
  Trying various AI tools, such as content automatic validation, intelligent publishing, optimizing writing and production toolchains.

- **Life Essays & Technical Experiments**
  
  Cycling stories, DIY hardware, home lab experiment records.

In short, this is my growth record on the path of technical documentation. If you also care about technical communication, developer experience, AI tools, or blog building, feel free to visit often.

## The Origin of "Flowing Docs"

Naming a blog is indeed not easy. I thought for a long time and finally settled on "Flowing Docs", which contains my profession, philosophy, and some personal elements.

- **Flowing**: Knowledge should flow like water, sharing and being used by others.
- **Docs**: Words that connect people, hoping to resonate with readers through communication.

The domain name `flowingdocs.com` came to me in a flash of inspiration. At that moment, I happened to think of the image of knowledge flowing like water, and my English name Walter sounds similar to Water, which corresponds to the meaning of "letting documents flow like water".

So, "Flowing Docs" is not just a name, but more like a reminder: write things that should flow and be seen and used by more people.

If one day you find that this place hasn't been updated for a long time, feel free to urge me to update 😂.

## What's Next?

Next, I will document the process of building this blog and some adjustment experiences. If you're interested in building a blog or documentation platform with Docusaurus, stay tuned!

Thank you for your patience in reading this far. See you in the next article!
